"The American Cops Officers Alliance is devoted to engaging the general public and the citizens on the issues that currently plague oversight boards already in place. From irregular discipline of officers in New York City to excessive spending plans in Chicago, we are committed to informing the concerns relating to these boards and oppose any future efforts that possibly objected to by ballot procedures in 2019.".<br><p><img src="https://americanpoliceofficersalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/american-police-officers-alliance-logo-636.png" alt="" width="353" height="87" /></p><p>American Police Officers Alliance<br />1655 Fort Myer Dr suite 700, Arlington, VA 22209<br />VWVH+HC Arlington, Mason, VA<br /><a href="https://americanpoliceofficersalliance.com/">https://americanpoliceofficersalliance.com/</a><br />(703) 935-4791</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/American+Police+Officers+Alliance/@38.8939461,-77.0736,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x245479a834ffaebb!8m2!3d38.8939461!4d-77.0714113!9m1!1b1?hl=en">Reviews</a></p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3105.313483198764!2d-77.07359998464969!3d38.89394607957117!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x245479a834ffaebb!2sAmerican+Police+Officers+Alliance!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1553353049014" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>The leading problems to this organization are:.<br><br>1) Securing policemans rights while maintaining the law.<br>2) Safeguarding policemans pensions and advantages that are currently under siege by blatantly anti-police authorities.<br>3) Electing strong authorities management at the regional level.<br>Both authorities and civilians continue to seek answers and much better solutions due to the fact that while they don't settle on how to make things much better, there is unity in seeing the need for enhancement to benefit the neighborhood and the guys and women that protect and serve.						</p>                    </section>                    <section>                        <h3>American Police Officers Alliance</h3>                        <p>The American Authorities Officers Alliance is a national political company arranged under Section 527.
