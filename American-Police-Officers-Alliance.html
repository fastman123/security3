These oversight boards have actually been long criticized by both the political left and right for inconsistent discipline, budget plan issues and selecting members at the desires of the politically linked..<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0FKu7XGAQ0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>Political Nonprofit That Supports Police</h2>												<p>" As more towns consider civilian oversight boards to discipline police misbehavior, there have actually been numerous problems that have actually plagued the effectiveness of these boards," stated Dan Stuebs, Executive Director of the American Cops Officers Alliance. "The American Cops Officers Alliance is committed to engaging the general public and the citizens on the problems that currently afflict oversight boards currently in location. From irregular discipline of officers in New York City to extreme spending plans in Chicago, we are dedicated to informing the concerns associating with these boards and oppose any future efforts that maybe objected to by ballot measures in 2019.".<br><p><img src="https://americanpoliceofficersalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/american-police-officers-alliance-logo-636.png" alt="" width="353" height="87" /></p><p>American Police Officers Alliance<br />1655 Fort Myer Dr suite 700, Arlington, VA 22209<br />VWVH+HC Arlington, Mason, VA<br /><a href="https://americanpoliceofficersalliance.com/">https://americanpoliceofficersalliance.com/</a><br />(703) 935-4791</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/American+Police+Officers+Alliance/@38.8939461,-77.0736,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x245479a834ffaebb!8m2!3d38.8939461!4d-77.0714113!9m1!1b1?hl=en">Reviews</a></p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3105.313483198764!2d-77.07359998464969!3d38.89394607957117!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x245479a834ffaebb!2sAmerican+Police+Officers+Alliance!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1553353049014" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>The top concerns to this organization are:.<br><br>1) Protecting law enforcement officers rights while supporting the law.<br>2) Protecting policemans pensions and advantages that are presently under siege by blatantly anti-police authorities.<br>3) Choosing strong cops leadership at the regional level.<br>Both police and civilians continue to seek responses and better services since while they do not settle on how to make things much better, there is unity in seeing the need for improvement to benefit the neighborhood and the guys and ladies that protect and serve.						</p>                    </section>                    <section>                        <h3>American Police Officers Alliance</h3>                        <p>The American Police Officers Alliance is a nationwide political company arranged under Section 527.
