Many of our pilots are former United States Armed force and NYPD people, so they come to us with a very disciplined background and training. Liberty uses extremely trained pilots with several years of experience. We need all pilots to receive Airbus factory training regularly, specifically the requirement of FAR part 135 air provider standards. Furthermore, our pilots are supported by a few of the most highly trained upkeep teams in the industry. Our pilots have a thorough knowledge of the northeast area and of NYC, as they are thrilled to provide our clients with a safe and professional helicopter ride over Manhattan, paired with understanding on a number of the city's top tourist attractions that can be seen by air.						</p>                    </section>                    <section>                        <h3></h3>                        <p> </p>                    </footer>                </article>                           </div> <!-- #main -->        </div> <!-- #main-container -->                <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>        <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/vendor/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/plugins.js"></script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/main.js"></script>    </body></html><br><br><p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/personalcare4/Drew-Schaefer-Liberty-Helicopters.html">Drew Schaefer</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/personalcare4/Drew-Schaefer-Liberty-Helicopters.html">Drew Schaefer Liberty Helicopters</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/personalcare4/Drew-Schaefer-Liberty-Helicopters.html">Drew Schaefer Americorp</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
